    body: 'The most alluring moon
    has risen over the forest;
    it is going to burn
    suspended in the center
    of the sky to lighten
    all the earth, all the woods,
    shining its light on all.
    Sweetly comes the air and the perfume.
    Happiness permeates all good men.
     
    We have arrived inside the woods
    where no one will see what we have
    come here to do.
     
    We have brought plumeria flowers,
    chucum blossoms, dog jasmines;
    we have the copal,
    the low cane vine,
    the land tortoise shell,
    new quartz, chalk and cotton thread;
    the new chocolate cup,
    the large fine flint,
    the new weight,
    the new needle work,
    gifts of turkeys, new leather,
    all new, even our hair bands,
    they touch us with nectar
    of the roaring conch shell
    of the ancients.
     
    Already, already
    we are in the heart of the woods,
    at the edge of the pool in the stone
    to await the rising
    of the lovely smoking star
    over the forest.
    Take off your clothes,
    let down your hair,
    become as you were
    when you arrived here on earth,
    virgins, maidens.',

    body: "Who is there within China to sympathize with him without?
    I ask for the ferry that will take me across the river,
    Originally I sought only food and salary, not the benefits of office,
    Only my parentsâ€™ glory, not my own needs.
    The traveler's road, rain falling upon the river;
    My former home, dreaming of return, springtime beneath the sun.
    Crossing the river I meet with fortune the broad waves.
    I wash ten years of dust from my humble cap strings.",
