# Cosmuse

### This is the fourth project I made as a student in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Course

## Full-Stack Application

### The project evaluated my ability to use React with Redux, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL with Active Record for the database

**About this project**:
  - I believe people find happiness when they are able to express themselves creatively. People are also fulfilled when they connect with other people. The cosmos has been the source of creative inspiration for as long as humans have looked up to the sky. I used a NASA API to provide people with beautiful pictures to inspire creative writing.

  - Technologies and libraries I used:
    - I used **React.js, Redux.js, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Active Record** and all of the dependencies that each of those packages have
    - I also used React Router and Styled Component packages
  - In Version 2, I would like to add:
    - User authentication
    - Comments on the posts
    - A way to share stories/poems/works on social media

  - Major takeaways:
    - **That's a Bold move Cotton**; I began the project trying to incorporate multiple technologies I had not used before. I am confident I will figure those technologies out, but trying to do it at once greatly hindered my progress. Half way through I started over, and my project suffered because of it. 
    - **Redux for the Win**; I did not use Redux in the previous project because I wanted to ensure I understood how React worked. I am confident in my React knowledge, so I used Redux this time. I now feel just as confident with React/Redux as I feel with React alone.
    - **Systems thinking is valuable**; I am leaving this takeaway from the previous project. The value of applying the models from basic systems thinking to the development of complex full-stack applications cannot be overstated. The entire app is just a series of feedback loops. Once I understood the cause and effect relationships between the individual elements of the system, I was able to isolate the points of leverage, and then I could select the most efficient solution to each problem. 
    - **There's a fine line between love and hate**; This is an extension of the first point. I cannot let a fumbled attempt at a technological leap forward tamp my passion for learning and growing. But I also can't sacrifice productivity for exploration. I will continue to build apps and try new things, but I will not lose focus of MVP.
